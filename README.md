## Premise

`mrods` was developed through the ABPHM17 Hackathon held in Bath, UK in May 2017.

**The problem:**  
Genomes are often compared on the basis of their shared genome content - the "core genome" - but this ignores structural changes such as large insertions/deletions, duplications and 
inversions.

**The proposed solution:**  
The basic concept is to quickly identify regions that may be of interest (either syntenic or differing regions) between *N* genomes, and output the results in a 
format amenable to quick visualisation e.g. table, SVG.
